=== What's New in 2.5 Since 2.4

This section covers the changes made from version 2.4 to version 2.5.
For changes in earlier version, see <<history>>.

Also see <<new-in-sik>>.

[[x25-factory-listeners]]
==== Consumer/Producer Factory Changes

The default consumer and producer factories can now invoke a callback whenever a consumer or producer is created or closed.
Implementations for native Micrometer metrics are provided.
See <<factory-listeners>> for more information.

You can now change bootstrap server properties at runtime, enabling failover to another Kafka cluster.
See <<connecting>> for more information.

[[x25-kafka-client]]
==== Kafka Client Version

This version requires the 2.5.0 `kafka-clients`.

==== Class/Package Changes

`SeekUtils` has been moved from the `o.s.k.support` package to `o.s.k.listener`.

[[x25-delivery]]
==== Delivery Attempts Header

There is now an option to to add a header which tracks delivery attempts when using certain error handlers and after rollback processors.
See <<delivery-header>> for more information.

[[x25-message-return]]
==== @KafkaListener Changes

Default reply headers will now be populated automatically if needed when a `@KafkaListener` return type is `Message<?>`.
See <<reply-message>> for more information.

The `KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_MESSAGE_KEY` is no longer populated with a `null` value when the incoming record has a `null` key; the header is omitted altogether.

`@KafkaListener` methods can now specify a `ConsumerRecordMetadata` parameter instead of using discrete headers for metadata such as topic, partition, etc.
See <<consumer-record-metadata>> for more information.

[[x25-container]]
==== Listener Container Changes

The `assignmentCommitOption` container property is now `LATEST_ONLY_NO_TX` by default.
See <<container-props>> for more information.

The `subBatchPerPartition` container property is now `true` by default when using transactions.
See <<transactions>> for more information.

A new `RecoveringBatchErrorHandler` is now provided.
See <<recovering-batch-eh>> for more information.

Static group membership is now supported.
See <<message-listener-container>> for more information.

When incremental/cooperative rebalancing is configured, if offsets fail to commit with a non-fatal `RebalanceInProgressException`, the container will attempt to re-commit the offsets for the partitions that remain assigned to this instance after the rebalance is completed.

The default error handler is now the `SeekToCurrentErrorHandler` for record listeners and `RecoveringBatchErrorHandler` for batch listeners.
See <<error-handlers>> for more information.

You can now control the level at which exceptions intentionally thrown by standard error handlers are logged.
See <<error-handlers>> for more information.

The `getAssignmentsByClientId()` method has been added, making it easier to determine which consumers in a concurrent container are assigned which partition(s).
See <<container-props>> for more information.

[[x25-template]]
==== KafkaTemplate Changes

The `KafkaTemplate` can now maintain micrometer timers.
See <<micrometer>> for more information.

The `KafkaTemplate` can now be configured with `ProducerConfig` properties to override those in the producer factory.
See <<kafka-template>> for more information.

A `RoutingKafkaTemplate` has now been provided.
See <<routing-template>> for more information.

You can now use `KafkaSendCallback` instead of `ListenerFutureCallback` to get a narrower exception, making it easier to extract the failed `ProducerRecord`.
See <<kafka-template>> for more information.

[[x25-string-serializer]]
==== Kafka String Serializer/Deserializer

New `ToStringSerializer`/`StringDeserializer` s as well as an associated `SerDe` are now provided.
See <<string-serde>> for more information.

[[x25-json-deser]]
==== JsonDeserializer

The `JsonDeserializer` now has more flexibility to determine the deserialization type.
See <<serdes-type-methods>> for more information.

[[x25-delegate-serde]]
==== Delegating Serializer/Deserializer

The `DelegatingSerializer` can now handle "standard" types, when the outbound record has no header.
See <<delegating-serialization>> for more information.

[[x25-testing]]
==== Testing Changes

The `KafkaTestUtils.consumerProps()` helper record now sets `ConsumerConfig.AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG` to `earliest` by default.
See <<junit>> for more information.
